# Pro Football Reference Scraper - Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED

### Core Scraping Infrastructure
- **`src/utils/pfr_scraper.py`** - Main scraper class with rate limiting
  - RateLimiter class: Enforces 10 requests/minute maximum
  - PFRScraper class: Handles all data extraction
  - HTML comment extraction: Bypasses PFR's anti-scraping measures
  - Team code mapping: Converts PFR codes to workbook codes

### Integration System
- **`src/scripts/integrate_pfr_data.py`** - Workbook enrichment tool
  - Loads existing NFL model workbook
  - Scrapes current season data from PFR
  - Merges stats with games dataframe
  - Creates differential features (home - away)
  - Saves enriched workbook with new sheets

### Documentation
- **`src/utils/PFR_SCRAPER_README.md`** - Complete usage guide
  - Quick start examples
  - Python API documentation
  - Rate limiting details
  - Model enhancement ideas
  - Troubleshooting guide
 - New integration script: [src/scripts/fetch_pfr_nflscrapy.py](src/scripts/fetch_pfr_nflscrapy.py) — integrates `nflscraPy` and writes directly to SQLite

### Dependencies Added
- `beautifulsoup4` - HTML parsing
- `lxml` - Fast XML/HTML processor
- `html5lib` - HTML5 parser
- `requests` - HTTP library (already present)

## 📊 Data Available

### Current Implementation
The scraper successfully extracts:

**Team Statistics (Season-Level)**:
- Games played
- Points scored/allowed
- Total yards offense/defense
- Plays run
- Yards per play
- Turnovers lost/forced
- Pass completions/attempts/yards/TDs/INTs
- Rush attempts/yards/TDs
- First downs
- Penalties and penalty yards
- Expected Points Total (EPA)
- Score percentage
- Turnover percentage

### Test Results
```
✓ Successfully scraped 32 teams
✓ Retrieved 29 statistical columns
✓ Proper team code mapping (LAR, NWE, etc.)
✓ Season identifier added
✓ Export to CSV working
```

Sample output:
```
   offense_ranker              team  offense_g  offense_points  offense_total_yards
0               1  Los Angeles Rams         17             452                 6508
1               2  New England Patriots      17             469                 6303
2               3  Seattle Seahawks         17             409                 6264
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Test
```bash
python src/scripts/integrate_pfr_data.py --test
# Output: outputs/pfr_test_team_stats.csv
```

### Basic Integration
```bash
python src/scripts/integrate_pfr_data.py --season 2025
# Creates: data/nfl_2025_model_data_with_moneylines_pfr.xlsx
```

### Full Integration (with game logs)
```bash
python src/scripts/integrate_pfr_data.py --season 2025 --game-logs
# Time: ~3-5 minutes due to rate limiting
# Scrapes: Team stats + game scores + 32 team game logs
```

### nflscraPy Integration (Default for DB Backfill)

Install:

```powershell
& "C:\Users\cahil\OneDrive\Desktop\Sports Model\NFL-Model\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -m pip install nflscraPy==0.1.3
```

Fetch 2025 metadata and stats (limit first 50 games):

```powershell
& "C:\Users\cahil\OneDrive\Desktop\Sports Model\NFL-Model\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" "src/scripts/fetch_pfr_nflscrapy.py" --season 2025 --tables metadata stats --limit 50
```

Backfill 2020–2025:

```powershell
& "C:\Users\cahil\OneDrive\Desktop\Sports Model\NFL-Model\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" "src/scripts/fetch_pfr_nflscrapy.py" --season 2025 --since 2020 --tables metadata stats expected_points scoring roster snap_counts splits fte --limit 25
```

Writes tables to [data/nfl_model.db](data/nfl_model.db):
- `pfr_seasons`, `pfr_metadata`, `pfr_stats`, `pfr_expected_points`, `pfr_scoring`, `pfr_roster`, `pfr_snap_counts`, `pfr_splits`, `fte_elo`

Notes:
- nflscraPy includes sleep between requests (3.5–5.5s); long runs are slow.
- Use `--limit` during initial setup to verify schemas before full backfill.

### Python API
```python
from src.utils.pfr_scraper import PFRScraper

scraper = PFRScraper()

# Get current season team stats
stats = scraper.get_team_stats(2025)
print(f"Retrieved {len(stats)} teams with {len(stats.columns)} columns")

# Get game scores
games = scraper.get_game_scores(2025, week=1)

# Get individual team game log  
nwe_log = scraper.get_team_game_log('NWE', 2025)
```

## 📈 Model Integration

### New Features Added
When you run the integration, your workbook gains:

**For each offensive stat** (e.g., `points`):
- `pfr_home_offense_points` - Home team's points scored this season
- `pfr_away_offense_points` - Away team's points scored this season
- `pfr_diff_offense_points` - Differential (home - away)

**Estimated new features**: ~100+ columns

### Impact on Model v3
These features complement your existing momentum metrics:

| Your Current Features | PFR Enhancement |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| 8-game rolling windows | Full season aggregates |
| EMA/trend calculations | Raw counting stats |
| Recent form | Long-term team quality |
| Market odds | Underlying performance |

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test Integration**:
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/integrate_pfr_data.py --test
   ```

2. **Run Basic Integration**:
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/integrate_pfr_data.py --season 2025
   ```

3. **Analyze New Features**:
   - Check correlation with outcomes
   - Identify top predictive stats
   - Add to model_v3 feature set

4. **Backfill Historical Data** (optional):
   ```python
   for year in range(2020, 2025):
       scraper.scrape_season_data(year, output_dir=f'data/pfr/{year}')
   ```

## ⚠️ Rate Limiting

### Built-in Protection
- **Maximum**: 10 requests per minute
- **Minimum interval**: 6 seconds between requests
- **Automatic waiting**: Pauses when approaching limit
- **Request tracking**: Monitors 60-second rolling window

### Expected Times
| Operation | Requests | Duration |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Team stats only | 1 | 6 seconds |
| Team stats + games | 2 | 12 seconds |
| Full season (32 teams) | ~38 | 4-5 minutes |

## 🔧 Technical Details

### HTML Comment Extraction
PFR hides tables in HTML comments to prevent scraping. Our solution:

```python
def _extract_tables_from_comments(self, soup):
    """Extract tables hidden in HTML comments"""
    from bs4 import Comment
    
    tables = {}
    comments = soup.find_all(string=lambda text: isinstance(text, Comment))
    
    for comment in comments:
        comment_soup = BeautifulSoup(comment, 'html.parser')
        for table in comment_soup.find_all('table'):
            table_id = table.get('id')
            if table_id:
                tables[table_id] = table
    
    return tables
```

### Team Code Mapping
```python
PFR_TO_WORKBOOK = {
    'nwe': 'NWE',  # New England Patriots
    'buf': 'BUF',  # Buffalo Bills
    'gnb': 'GNB',  # Green Bay Packers
    'sdg': 'LAC',  # Los Angeles Chargers
    'rai': 'LVR',  # Las Vegas Raiders
    # ... all 32 teams
}
```

## 🔒 Safety & Ethics

### What We Do Right
✅ Respect 10 requests/minute limit  
✅ Identify ourselves with User-Agent  
✅ Only scrape publicly available data  
✅ No circumventing paywalls  
✅ Proper attribution in documentation  

### What We Avoid
❌ No rapid-fire requests  
❌ No distributed scraping  
❌ No commercial redistribution  
❌ No accessing subscriber-only content  

### Attribution

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Defensive stats** - Not yet implemented (table ID `team_stats_opp`)
   - Easy fix: Already have code structure, need to find correct table
   
2. **Advanced stats** - Requires subscription
   - EPA, success rate, pressure stats may be paywalled
   
3. **Player stats** - Not implemented
   - Would need aggregation logic to team level
   
4. **Historical data** - Manual scraping for each season
   - Could automate with loop (respecting rate limits)

5. **Game logs** - Slow to scrape (32 teams = 3-5 minutes)
   - Trade-off: rich data vs. time

## 💡 Enhancement Ideas

### Phase 2 Features
- [ ] Defensive stats integration
- [ ] Play-by-play data (if accessible)
- [ ] Situational splits (3rd down, red zone)
- [ ] Injury report tracking
- [ ] Coaching/roster changes

### Phase 3 Features
- [ ] Multi-season backfill automation
- [ ] Weekly auto-updates via cron/scheduled task
